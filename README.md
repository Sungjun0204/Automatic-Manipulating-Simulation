# Automatic-Manipulating-Simulation
Simulation Code

- SCARA drags the magnetic robot to the point X through magnetic force with PD Control
- The magnetic robot is affected the wall of the track but not SCARA
- Applied by SCARA impedance control between end effect and magnetic robot, so SCARA don't miss the magnetic robot


# Code Description
[simulation_code] simulates the system on M track
[simulation_code_2] simulates the system on S track
